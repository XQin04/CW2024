## Compilation Instructions

Follow these steps to compile and run the application:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XQin04/CW2024.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd sky-battle
   ```

3. **Ensure JavaFX is configured:**

    - Download and install JavaFX SDK if not already installed.
    - Set the `--module-path` and `--add-modules` flags in your IDE or command-line execution.


4. **Run the application from the command line:**

   ```bash
   java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.media -jar SkyBattle.jar
   ```

5. **Dependencies:**

   **Check and Set Java SDK Version:**
   - Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
   - Ensure the **SDK** is set to Java 19 (Amazon Corretto 19.0.2, as shown in your screenshot).
   - Verify the **Language Level** is compatible with JavaFX (11 or higher).
   - Ensure all required libraries are included in your classpath.

## Implemented and Working Properly

### Core Features:

1. **Main Menu:**

    - The `MainMenu` class provides a comprehensive starting interface for the game.
    - Includes methods such as `start()`, `createMainMenuLayout()`, and `createSettingsLayout()` for options like "Start Game," "Settings," "How to Play," and "Exit."
    - The "Settings" option allows players to toggle background music and sound effects using checkboxes, leveraging the `SoundManager` class for state management.
    - "How to Play" presents gameplay instructions using `createHowToPlayLayout()` for objectives and controls.

2. **Pause Menu:**

    - The `PauseMenu` class provides in-game pause functionality through methods like `createStyledButton()` and `configureLayout()`.
    - Features options to "Resume" gameplay, return to the main menu, or exit the application.

3. **End Game Menu:**

    - The `EndGameMenu` class appears at the conclusion of the game (win or loss).
    - Dynamically updates the title to "You Win" or "Game Over" using the `show()` method.
    - Provides options to return to the main menu or exit the game with methods such as `createStyledButton()`.

4. **Player Movement:**

    - The `InputHandler` class enables smooth player control using methods like `handleInput()` for movement in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
    - Integrates seamlessly with the `UserSuperman` character's movement logic.

5. **Boss Spider Behavior in Level Two:**

    - The `BossSpider` class in LevelTwo uses the `shootProjectile()` method to fire a large projectile.
    - The explosion and fragment behavior are managed using the `BossProjectile` class with methods like `scheduleExplosion()` and `spawnExplodingFragments()`.

6. **Level Three Waves:**

    - The `LevelThree` class introduces waves of `EnemySpider` units using `generateEnemyWaves()`.
    - The final wave features the `BossSpider` as the level's climax, providing a challenging boss fight.

7. **Level Three Power-Ups:**

    - LevelThree incorporates collectible `SpreadshotPowerUp` items.
    - The `activate()` method in the `SpreadshotPowerUp` class grants the player the ability to shoot multiple projectiles simultaneously, enhancing attack capabilities.

---

## Implemented but Not Working Properly

1. **Background Music Mute Issue:**

    - Initially, when background music was muted via the `MainMenu` settings, it would still play when the game was paused and resumed.
    - Added a checker in the `PauseMenu` class using `setMusicMuted()` and `isMusicMuted()` in the `SoundManager` to ensure mute state consistency during transitions.

2. **Spreadshot Power-Up Count:**

    - Collecting multiple `SpreadshotPowerUp` items simultaneously only allowed the user to shoot one spread shot.
    - Modified the `PowerUpManager` and `UserSuperman` classes to include methods like `incrementSpreadshotCount()` and `decrementSpreadshotCount()` to track and apply multiple power-ups.

---

## Features Not Implemented

1. **Online Leaderboard:**

    - Planned to integrate an online leaderboard for players to compare scores.
    - Not implemented due to the time constraints.

2. **Dynamic Weather Effects:**

    - Intended to include dynamic weather effects (e.g., rain, thunder) to enhance game immersion.
    - Omitted due to the complexity of integrating animations and ensuring performance across systems.

## Unexpected Problems

1. **Game Crash in Level One:**

    - Encountered a `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException` error when playing Level One due to an incorrect file type for the shield image.
    - Fixed by updating the image file extension from `.jpg` to `.png` in the `ShieldImage` class.

2. **Game Crash on Transition to Level Two:**

    - The game crashed when transitioning to Level Two due to resources not being cleared from Level One.
    - Fixed by adding cleanup code in the `goToNextLevel` method of the `LevelParent` class:
      ```java
      timeline.stop(); // Stop the current game loop.
      root.getChildren().clear(); // Clear all nodes from the scene to release resources.
      ```

3. **Shield Image Not Displaying in Level Two:**

    - The shield image failed to render during Level Two when the boss was shielded.
    - Replaced the shield image with a glowing effect using `DropShadow` to enhance visual clarity and provide a dynamic indicator for the shield's state.
    - The glow effect allows better visibility during gameplay and avoids image overlap issues with other UI elements.
